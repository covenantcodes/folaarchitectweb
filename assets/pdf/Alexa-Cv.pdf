Finally, LinkedIn Family, BSC International Relations in the bag.

It took me this long to write this here for some reasons.

As a student I have successfully launched 2 organisations and train over 4000 human beings.

I have directed and managed 10 events in the last two years.

I have occupied 11 Positions in the Last two Years.

I have gained skills such as Digital Marketing, Public Relations, Graphic Designing, Video Editing and Creation, Voice Editing, Project Management and Product Management, Team Management, Research Writing and Content Creation in the last two Years.

I can go on and on. I am specific about the fact that it was just between this year and last year because I want to tell someone today that it is never too late.

I started all of this in my 300l at Obafemi Awolowo University, now see.

See mind blowing result in two years.

This week, stay focused and excel at what you do.

You can begin!

Congratulations are in order!

Undergraduate years Well Spent!
